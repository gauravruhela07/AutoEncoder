# AutoEncoder

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”.

## Description

This code for autoencoder is implemented in python using keras. The dataset used is MNIST for training.
